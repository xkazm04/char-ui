# Asset generator
The Asset Management System serves as a comprehensive toolkit for creating, organizing, and utilizing visual assets for characters in creative and entertainment environment. It allows creators to:

## Asset extraction
1. **Categorize and organize assets** into a hierarchical structure based on four main categories:
- **Body elements** (hairstyles, facial features, body modifications)
- **Equipment** (weapons, armor, tools, wearable technology)
- **Clothing** (upper/lower wear, footwear, headwear, accessories)
- **Background elements** (settings, visual effects, environmental objects)

2. **Search** and filter assets through an intuitive interface, allowing quick discovery of specific items across an extensive library.
3. **Analyze and extract** metadata from visual content, automatically categorizing new assets through AI vision technology.
4. **Preview and modify** assets before implementing them in character designs.

## Business Value Proposition
- **Accelerating character creation** workflows through intelligent organization and quick-access filtering.
- **Enhancing creative consistency** by providing a centralized repository of pre-approved visual elements.
- **Reducing redundant asset creation** by making existing assets discoverable and reusable with vector comparison.
- **Bridging technical and creative roles** with a visual interface that **doesn't require programming knowledge**.
- **Scaling** content production by enabling efficient management of large asset libraries without performance degradation.

## Innovations & Tech
The solution leverages several innovative technologies:

- **AI-powered categorization** that automatically analyzes and tags visual assets, reducing manual classification work.
- Reactive UI architecture that provides **real-time feedback** as users select and combine different assets.
- Advanced search capabilities that go beyond simple text matching to include visual similarity and contextual relevance.
- Category-based visualization that helps users understand the relationships between different asset types.

### LLM models
Multimodal LLMs for image analysis, up to user to select from
- Groq provider: meta-llama/**llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct** - Provided for demo users for free
- Google: **gemini-1.5-flash** - Requires Gemini API Key from user 
- OpenAI: **gpt-4o** - Requires OpenAI API Key from user

### MongoDB
- TBD after playing with image processing a bit more. Core concepts
- Easy BE asset management thanks to text/vector/image representation in one table
- Real-time fast vector similarity search


### DevOps
- TBD deployment paragraph to write after Google Cloud experience in final hackathon phases 


## Use cases
- App or separate modules could be developed further for

TBD
1. Indie game development - 3D Asset management app/plugin
2. Creative media - Artwork generation, Shorts
